"Mom pacman broke X again!"
---------------------------

If pacman breaks your rc.lua:
- check for /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua
- make sure this copy works
- start from this and add your tweaks back in (diff helps a lot here)
- ???
- profit

Random vim note:
vim -O file1 file2
:diffthis
ctrl+w l or h

can diff files like a boss
